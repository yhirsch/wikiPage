			A <b>fast attack craft (FAC)</b> is a small, fast, agile, offensive, often affordable warship armed with <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile" target="_blank"> anti-ship
				missiles </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_artillery" target="_blank">gun</a> or <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo" target="_blank"> torpedoes</a>. FACs are usually operated
			in close proximity to land as they lack both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seakeeping"
				target="_blank">
				seakeeping </a>and all-round defensive capabilities to survive in blue water. The size of the vessel
			also limits
			the fuel, stores and water supplies. In size they are usually between 50–800 tonnes and can reach speeds of
			25–50 knots (46–93 km/h).

		<h3>19th Century</h3>
		<p>
			As early as the mid-19th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeune_%C3%89cole"
				target=_blank> Jeune École's</a> <i>poussiere navale theory</i> called for a great number of
			small, agile vessels to break up invading fleets of larger vessels. The idea was first put into action in
			the 1870s with the steam-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_boat" target=_blank>torpedo
				boats</a>, which were produced in large numbers by both the Royal Navy
			and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Navy" target=_blank> French Navy</a>. These new
			vessels proved especially susceptible to rough seas and to have limited
			utility in scouting due to their short endurance and low bridges. The potential threat was entirely
			extinguished with the introduction of the torpedo boat destroyer (TBD) in 1893, a larger vessel which
			evolved into the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer" target=_blank>destroyer</a>. It
			could mount guns capable of destroying the torpedo boat before it was
			within range to use its own weapons.

		<h3>20th century</h3>

		<p>

			The idea was revived shortly before World War I with the craft using new gasoline engines. Italy and Great
			Britain were at the forefront of this design, with the <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Motor_Boat" target=_blank> coastal motor boat (CMB)</a> and
			the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAS_(motorboat)" target=_blank> <i>motobarca armata</i> </a>
			silurante (MAS) (Italian: "torpedo armed motorboat"). The outstanding achievement of the class was the
			sinking of the Austro-Hungarian battleship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Szent_Istv%C3%A1n"
				target=_blank>SMS <i>Szent István</i></a>by MAS. 15 on June 10, 1918. The equivalent
			achievement for the CMBs was a lesser success; during the <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" target=_blank>Russian Civil War</a> CMBs attacked
			the Red Fleet at
			anchor at Kronstadt on June 18, 1919, sinking the cruiser <i>Pamiat Azova</i> for the loss of four craft.

			The design matured in the mid-1930s as the motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and motor gunboats (MGBs) of the Royal
			Navy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_boat" target=_blank>PT boats</a> of the US Navy, and the
			E-boats (Schnellboote) of the Kriegsmarine. All types saw
			extensive use during World War II but were limited in effectiveness due to the increasing threat of
			aircraft; however, some successes were achieved in favourable conditions, as showcased by the crippling of
			the cruiser HMS Manchester (later scuttled), in the night of 13 August 1942, by Italian MS boats.
