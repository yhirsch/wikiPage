			A <b>fast attack craft (FAC)</b> is a small, fast, agile, offensive, often affordable warship armed with <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile" target="_blank"> anti-ship
				missiles </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_artillery" target="_blank">gun</a> or <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo" target="_blank"> torpedoes</a>. FACs are usually operated
			in close proximity to land as they lack both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seakeeping"
				target="_blank">
				seakeeping </a>and all-round defensive capabilities to survive in blue water. The size of the vessel
			also limits
			the fuel, stores and water supplies. In size they are usually between 50–800 tonnes and can reach speeds of
			25–50 knots (46–93 km/h).A fast attack craft's main advantage over other warship types is its affordability.
			Many FACs can be deployed at a relatively low cost, allowing a navy which is at a disadvantage to
			effectively defend itself against a larger adversary.[2] A small boat, when equipped with the same weapons
			as its larger counterpart, can pose a serious threat to even the largest of capital ships. Their major
			disadvantages are poor seagoing qualities, cramped quarters and poor defence against aerial threats.

			<p>
				As early as the mid-19th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeune_%C3%89cole"
					target=_blank> Jeune École's</a> <i>poussiere navale theory</i> called for a great number of
				small, agile vessels to break up invading fleets of larger vessels. The idea was first put into
				action in
				the 1870s with the steam-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_boat"
					target=_blank>torpedo
					boats</a>, which were produced in large numbers by both the Royal Navy
				and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Navy" target=_blank> French Navy</a>. These
				new
				vessels proved especially susceptible to rough seas and to have limited
				utility in scouting due to their short endurance and low bridges. The potential threat was entirely
				extinguished with the introduction of the torpedo boat destroyer (TBD) in 1893, a larger vessel
				which
				evolved into the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer" target=_blank>destroyer</a>.
				It
				could mount guns capable of destroying the torpedo boat before it was
				within range to use its own weapons.

				The idea was revived shortly before World War I with the craft using new gasoline engines. Italy and
				Great
				Britain were at the forefront of this design, with the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Motor_Boat" target=_blank> coastal motor boat
					(CMB)</a> and
				the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAS_(motorboat)" target=_blank> <i>motobarca armata</i>
				</a>
				silurante (MAS) (Italian: "torpedo armed motorboat"). The outstanding achievement of the class was
				the
				sinking of the Austro-Hungarian battleship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Szent_Istv%C3%A1n"
					target=_blank>SMS <i>Szent
						István</i></a>by MAS. 15 on June 10, 1918. The equivalent
				achievement for the CMBs was a lesser success; during the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" target=_blank>Russian Civil War</a> CMBs
				attacked
				the Red Fleet at
				anchor at Kronstadt on June 18, 1919, sinking the cruiser <i>Pamiat Azova</i> for the loss of four
				craft.

				The design matured in the mid-1930s as the motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and motor gunboats (MGBs) of
				the Royal
				Navy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_boat" target=_blank>PT boats</a> of the US Navy,
				and the
				E-boats (Schnellboote) of the Kriegsmarine. All types saw
				extensive use during World War II but were limited in effectiveness due to the increasing threat of
				aircraft; however, some successes were achieved in favourable conditions, as showcased by the
				crippling of
				the cruiser HMS Manchester (later scuttled), in the night of 13 August 1942, by Italian MS boats.

			After World War II, the use of this kind of craft steadily declined in the United States and Britain,
			despite the introduction of safer diesel engines to replace the highly flammable gasoline ones, although
			the
			Soviet Union still had large numbers of MGBs and MTBs in service.With the development of the anti-ship
			missile, FACs were reborn in the Soviet Union as "missile boats" or "missile cutters". The first few
			missile
			boats were originally torpedo boats, with the torpedo tubes replaced by missile launchers. Again, small
			fast
			craft could attack and destroy a major warship. The idea was first tested by the Soviet Union which, in
			August 1957, produced the Komar class which mounted two P-15 Termit missiles on a 25-metre (82 ft) hull
			with
			a top speed of around 40 knots (74 km/h; 46 mph). Endurance was limited to 1,000 nautical miles (1,900
			km;
			1,200 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and the vessels had supplies for only five days at sea. 110
			Komar-class vessels were produced, while over 400 examples were built of the following Osa class with a
			significant portion of the total being sold to pro-Soviet nations.

			The first combat use of missile boats was an attack by two Egyptian Soviet-built Komar-class boats on
			the
			Israeli destroyer Eilat on 20 October 1967, several months after the Six-Day War. The two boats launched
			a
			total of four P-15 missiles, three of which struck the Eilat and sank her with the loss of 47 crew dead
			or
			missing and over 90 wounded.[3] The Soviet FACs prompted a NATO response, which became more intense
			after
			the sinking of Eilat. The Germans and French worked together to produce a new FAC, resulting in the La
			Combattante class, first commissioned in 1968. Built on a 47-or-49-metre (154 or 161 ft) hull with four
			MM-38 Exocet missiles, a 76 mm gun forward and 40 mm twin guns aft, these vessels have a top speed of 36
			knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). Built until 1974, a total of 68 Combattante IIs were launched. The design was
			immediately followed by the Combattante III, and a great many other shipyards produced their own
			versions of
			the Combattante, including the Israeli Sa'ar/Reshef variants.

			Size has also increased, some designs reaching up to corvette size, 800 tonnes including a helicopter,
			giving them extended modes of operation. While the Israeli Sa'ar 4-class missile boats, for example, had
			a
			58 metre hull and 415 ton displacement, the Sa'ar 5 is 85 metres in length and displaces 1,065 tons, and
			is
			officially rated as a corvette.

			Iran and North Korea have some of the largest numbers of FACs in operation today. North Korea alone
			operates
			more than 300,[4] while Iran has been seen developing "swarm boats" to be used as harassing vessels in
			the
			heavily contested littoral waters of the Persian Gulf. To counter the threat, the US Navy has been
			developing an ASUW Littoral Defensive Anti Surface Warfare doctrine, along with vessels such as the
			littoral
			combat ship.
